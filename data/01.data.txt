life does not have to be perfect to be wonderful
that there is some good in this world and it is worth fighting for
the beginning is the most important part of the work
there is no one i would rather be than me
we will have a fresh start for the year ahead
take a few minutes to appreciate what you have and how far you have come
i am not old age is nothing 
today at the edge of our hope at the end of our time we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves but in each other
the rough road often leads to the top
all the advantage is not in running fast but rather in getting an early start
it does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop
try and fail but do not fail to try
if you really want to do something you will find a way
if you do not you will find an excuse
in life patience is the key
it is much better to be going somewhere slowly than nowhere fast
try your best even if the task seems difficult
hello 2014 may all my wishes come true
forget all the reasons why it will not work and believe the one reason why it will
the distance between your dreams and reality is called action
we must face tomorrow whatever it may hold with determination joy and bravery
life is a roller coaster
you can scream every time you hit a bump or you can throw your hands up and enjoy the ride
death is so final whereas life is so full of possibilities
progress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything
it is better to have fought and lost than never to have fought at all
life is too short for us to wake up in the morning with regrets
doing what you like is freedom
liking what you do is happiness
if you want something you have never had you must be willing to do something you have never done
every day may not be good but there is something good in every day
be strong believe in who you are
be strong believe in what you feel
if you are lucky enough to be different do not ever change
everything will be okay in the end
if it is not okay it is not the end
hope my warm hello will brighten up your world hello day
do not give up just be you
because life is too short to be anybody else
smile and let everyone know that today you are a lot stronger than you were yesterday
great minds have purpose others have wishes
a strong man stands up for himself
a stronger man stands up for others
the only person you should try to be better than is who you were yesterday
all you can do is to try your best
even with those small steps you are closer to your goal than you were yesterday
a smile is the shortest distance between two people
courage is being afraid but going on anyhow
a man can be destroyed but not defeated
a truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery while on a detour
no dream is too big and no dreamer is too small
it does not matter how many times you fail
what matters is how many times you stand up and try again
silence is the most powerful cry
a little consideration a little thought for others makes all the difference
stop waiting for things to happen
go out and make them happen
do not look forward to tomorrow do not miss yesterday to grasp today
now we do not call it alive
it is just not to die
you can change your life if you want to
sometimes you have to be hard on yourself but you can change it completely
time will bring a surprise if you believe
what others think is not important
how you feel about yourself is all that matters
do not cry because it is over smile because it happened
tomorrow is never clear
life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all
pursue excellence and success will follow
climb mountains not so the world can see you but so you can see the world
every step towards your dream today is a step away from your regret tomorrow
it is never too late to be what you might have been
it is time to start living the life you have imagined
there is nothing more beautiful than a smile that struggles through tears
when you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe then you will be successful
when you have choices choose the best
when you have no choice do your best
do not follow others steps when making your own trip
life is not the amount of breaths you take it is the moments that take your breath away
every new day is another chance to change your life
stop trying to find a rewind
it is life not a movie
the man who has made up his mind to win will never say impossible
done is better than perfect
i can make it through the rain
i can stand up once again on my own
there is no point in living if you can not feel alive
turn the page on yesterday
only ever think about today and tomorrow
chance favors only the prepared mind
trust is like an eraser
it gets smaller and smaller after every mistake
life is tough but i am tougher
if you do not think about your future you cannot have it
do what you can with what you have where you are
there are no perfect relationships
it is how you accept the imperfections that makes it perfect
you can not have a better tomorrow if you are still thinking about yesterday
it is not because things are difficult that we do not dare it is because we do not dare that things are difficult
have the courage to follow it
how can men succumb to force
life is like live tv show
there is no rehearsal
dress shabbily and they remember the dress
dress impeccably and they remember the woman
hope is a good thing maybe the best of things
and no good thing ever dies
there are so many beautiful reasons to be happy
where the more different you are the better
i am only brave when i have to be
being brave does not mean you go looking for trouble
behind every successful man there is a lot of unsuccessful years
if you want something done do it yourself
life is a wonderful journey
make it your journey and not someone else is
no matter how many mistakes you make or how slowly you progress you are already ahead of those who never tried
some things are so important that they force us to overcome our fears
say to yourself no matter how many obstacles i encounter in life i will do all that i can to complete the whole course
try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value
remember when life is path is steep to keep your mind even
if you are brave enough to say goodbye life will reward you with a new hello
sometimes the right path is not the easiest one
just trust yourself then you will know how to live
in life it is not where you go
it is who you travel with
life is like a rainbow
you do not always know what is on the other side but you know it is there
when the world says give up hope whispers try it one more time
i do not care about other questions and i just try to be myself
attempt does not necessarily bring success but giving up definitely leads to failure
the best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today
you are already naked
there is no reason not to follow your heart
life is a journey one that is much better traveled with a companion by our side
sometimes you have to fall before you can fly
if you are able to appreciate beauty in the ordinary your life will be more vibrant
be who you are and never ever apologize for that 
consider the bad times as down payment for the good times
do not pray for easy lives pray to be stronger
everybody can fly without wings when they hold on to their dreams
there is no such thing as a great talent without great will power
you can not change your situation
the only thing that you can change is how you choose to deal with it
whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well
perfection is not just about control
it is also about letting go
dream is what makes you happy even when you are just trying
never frown because you never know who is falling in love with your smile
it is easy once you know how
in order to be irreplaceable one must always be different
i honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate
run you will make it to tomorrow
life comes with many challenges
the ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of
life does not just happen to you
you receive everything in your life based on what you have given
you are more beautiful than you think
throughout life is complications you should maintain such a sense of elegance
when you feel like giving up remember why you held on so long in the first place
you will never be younger than you are at this very moment
you should better bring cause i will bring every i have got it
take time to enjoy the simple things in life
as long as you are still alive you will definitely encounter the good things in life
hold on it gets better than you know
if you are fine the sun will always shine
what does not kill you makes you stronger
every life deserves our respect
the best feeling in the world is when you know your heart is smiling
do not ever underestimate the heart of a champion
there is nothing permanent except change
the difference between successful persons and others is that they really act
do not follow the crowd let the crowd follow you
people pay in advance for a coffee meant for someone who cannot afford a warm beverage
no one is born a genius
just keep on doing what you like and that itself is a talent
the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
you can create something more glorious than the championship
you never get a second chance to make a first impression
you can always be a worse version of him or better version of yourself
give every day the chance to become the most beautiful day of your life
honesty is the best policy
to a crazy ship all winds are contrary
the outer world you see is a reflection of your inner self
strike while the iron is hot
knowing what you cannot do is far more important than knowing what you are capable of
people cry not because they are weak
it is because they have been strong for too long
do not let yesterday use up too much of today
if you are not brave enough no one will back you up
if you do not build your dream someone will hire you to build theirs
beauty is all around if you just open your heart to see
the difference in winning and losing is most often
i am ordinary yet unique
i like people who make me laugh in spite of myself
image a new story for your life and start living it
i would rather be a happy fool than a sad sage
the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
even if you get no applause you should accept a curtain call gracefully and appreciate your own efforts
do not let dream just be your dream
a day without laughter is a day wasted
travel and see the world
afterwards you will be able to put your concerns in perspective
the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition
you can be happy no matter what
a good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow
nothing is impossible the word itself says i am possible
life is not fair but no matter your circumstances you have to give it your all
no matter how hard it is just keep going because you only fail when you give up
it requires hard work to give off an appearance of effortlessness
life is like riding a bicycle
to keep your balance you must keep moving
be thankful for what you have
you will end up having more
beauty is how you feel inside and it reflects in your eyes
friendship doubles your joys and divides your sorrows
when you long for something sincerely the whole world will help you
say your love today the chance may come late
there is a crack in everything
that is how the light gets in
do something today that your future self will thank you for
you miss 100% of the shots you never take
things have a way of working out when you least expect it
whatever your past has been you have a spotless future
dare and the world always yields
with enough hard work and dedication anything is possible
happiness consists in contentment
your future depends on your dreams
today is an opportunity to get better
happiness is good health and a bad memory
you learn to take life as it comes at you
however long the night the dawn will break
we all have our places in the world
it is okay to have flaws which makes you real
just hold to your dream and never give up
it is dogged that does it
my success is based on persistence not luck
whether you fail or fly at least you tried
people tend to confuse bad decisions with bad luck
the purpose of life is to enjoy every moment
after a hurricane comes a rainbow
our attitude defines life
do one thing at a time and do it well
take the moment and make it perfect
he who laughs last laughs best
keep trying do not give up the ship
sometimes you have to be your own hero
have the faith for a better tomorrow
i can accept failure but i can not accept not trying
dreams are made possible if you try
nothing really matters except to live or die
chance favors the prepared mind
one today is worth two tomorrows
the darkest hour is that before the dawn
the good seaman is known in bad weather
goals determine what you are going to be
any time spent being unhappy is wasted
the devil is always in the details
i feel strongly that i can make it
always be a first-rate version of yourself
god helps those who help themselves
think big goals and win big success
you have to believe in yourself
that is the secret of success
a glamorous life is quite different to a life of luxury
may there be enough clouds in your life to make a beautiful sunset
what seems to us as bitter trials are often blessings in disguise
to ask why we fight is to ask why the leaves fall
that it will never come again is what makes life sweet
i can not control their fear only my own
you can not do it — that is the biggest lie on earth
a good book is an event in my life
without the dark we would never see the stars
worse than not realizing the dreams of your youth would be to have been young and never dreamed at all
the stars change but the mind remains the same
but i will not live for you
when you want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it
nothing is impossible the word itself says i am possible 
no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
it is the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting
the longest way must have its close
the gloomiest night will wear on to a morning
stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away
and yellow leaves of autumn which have no songs flutter and fall there with a sign
a troupe of little vagrants of the world leave your footprints in my words
the world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover
it becomes small as one song as one kiss of the eternal
it is the tears of the earth that keep here smiles in bloom
the mighty desert is burning for the love of a blade of grass who shakes her head and laughs and flies away
if you shed tears when you miss the sun you also miss the stars
the sands in your way beg for your song and your movement dancing water
will you carry the burden of their lameness
her wishful face haunts my dreams like the rain at night
once we dreamt that we were strangers
we wake up to find that we were dear to each other
sorrow is hushed into peace in my heart like the evening among the silent trees
it is the best life to be clean every night to fall asleep exhausted with peace of mind to wake up fresh calm and energetic every day
the car has oil the cell phone has electricity and cary has money
that is the sense of security
it expects others to be bullshit
no matter how hard the co-driver is it is better to grip the steering wheel by himself
what is perfect it is the volume of the headphones that just covers the outside noise
when the alarm clock rings you just wake up naturally and the person you love just loves you
no matter what age you are i think we should all learn to be gentle with the people around us at least not to add to others by saying things because you may not know that language really has a magical power it will let the person you love love love love you will also let the person who loves you decide to leave you
the older i grow up the more i realize that the most important thing i can do is to have my family
i do not want to be rich or rich
i want my family to be painless disease-free and healthy
gradually learned that many things can be met but not sought do not belong to their own why desperately care about you care about what what will torture you expectation is the root of all heartache
people will never cherish three kinds of people one is easy to get
the other is never to leave
and the third is that it has always been good for you
but often these three people will never come back once they leave
do not be too obsessed with the present or worry about the future
when you experience something the scenery is different from the past
do not get acquainted with anyone too quickly
do not think that the topic is the same at the beginning
there are many things in common
you are the intimate friends who hate meeting late
language is often false and what we experience together is true
many relationships are not good old or new but after some experiences together you really feel that the other party is good which is the relationship that deserves your serious attention and heart
some should be picked up some should be abandoned
because only let the end of the end the beginning will begin
no matter who you meet he is the right person in your life
he will teach you something
so i also believe that wherever i go it is my place to go to experience something i should experience to meet the people i should meet
always live for yourself and the smile should be particularly brilliant do not care about other people is advice do yourself well so that those who look down on you can not climb up so that those who look up to you like you more
too much accommodation will make others more difficult for you
too much tolerance will make others hurt you inch by inch
in fact most of the people you meet are accustomed to your good
in the next life i want to be a dandelion without concern without desire or desire
i want to walk in the wind quiet and peaceful
do not be confused in the heart do not be trapped in the feelings do not fear the future do not think about the past so well
if you decide to give up please give up cleanly
those who decide never to meet again really do not want to meet
please do not let me betray myself any more
if you want to love others please love yourself first
do not expect do not imagine do not demand let it be if destined it will happen
peace of mind is the best state of being alive
people like rainbows know when they meet
interesting souls will eventually meet
before that try to be a better self
when you grow up in the world sometimes you tell the truth you have to apologize to others because you have punctured the truth
so if you want to live smoothly take your mind with you all the time
you are going to be a quiet adult
do not be emotional do not secretly miss do not look back
live a different life for yourself
be obedient not all fish will live in the same ocean
do not care too much about the superficial emotions between people
people who have close acquaintances do not need them
people who have extensive acquaintances do not need them
emotion you do not care it will not hurt you
when something goes wrong with your body you will realize that everything you worry about is fart you are full you are idle and it is more important to live healthily than anything else
the reasons for all the weakening of the relationship are not to say not to ask
one asks embarrassingly the other answers perfunctorily does not say thinks that the other party understands does not ask thinks that the other party has changed and finally becomes speechless from speechless to speechless
never be poor never be naive
maturity is only good at hiding vicissitudes of life are just no tears and injuries
man with a dream of red mansions he lives in the world of the marsh
he wants to make some brothers in taoyuan in the three kingdoms but he always encounters some devils in his travels to the west
the more people do it the easier it is for you to get out
so many times you should be grateful to those who do not care about you
no sorrow is greater than death and no luck is more complete than death
some things not the thicker the better to be just right
deep words we say shallowly the long road we take slowly
your kindness should be left to those who know how to be grateful not to those who take your kindness for granted and want to be dissatisfied
every night can be clean safe exhausted to sleep
every day can be refreshing calm energetic wake up this is the best life
vulnerable people will lobby their misfortunes everywhere
strong people will only be more and more quiet
fall in love a few months to had thought for a lifetime the friend is good to you a bit you want to come and go all one is life parwonder you are injured so much this is the price that innocent gives you
if the person i care about is cold and hot to me and i feel the gain and loss then i will choose to leave because i do not have so much patience to taste the feeling of gain and loss
this short life we will eventually lose
you might as well be bold love a person climb a mountain chase a dream
it takes a moment to reach out but it takes many years to hold hands
whoever you meet he is the person in your life
if you do not owe each other how can you meet each other
when i was a child i thought that the most romantic thing was that one person went a long way to see another person
now i understand that the most romantic thing is that no matter how far a person goes he thinks of the same person in his heart
the so-called poems and distant places but to get through the present can have
time is the most deceptive but also let you understand that there is nothing in the world that can not be lost leaving is the scenery leaving behind is life to the end is the right person
everyone is the same there is a period of time alone long or short which is unavoidable
do not always feel empty rest assured a moment of loneliness just means you deserve better
it is better to use the time of loneliness to make oneself better surprise the people and give oneself a good account
time is like a big sieve which can withstand filtering and think it is a good friend to play with
maybe it is not as good as you think
only after the test of time people will see each other for a long time and finally stay is the real friend
someday your edges and corners will be smoothed by the world
you will no longer be angry and sad about trifles nor resentful about some trifles
you will pull out the thorns you will learn to smile at the people you hate become quiet you will become a quiet person
i have for you cry from now on you do not deserve my smile
hiding in own corner of stability and calm
we hadd better struggle for the future rather than regret for the past
love but not to talk from no words to say nothing
if do not have if you do not need to lose
i still love only less than with persistent
we were just kids in love
indulges the missing pain troubled inventorying has dripped lonely the rough sound
i am not lazy i just really enjoy doing noting
i have always been with you
betray me i will let you have nothing
you do not have much good i like it
could ever replace you
it is the young and the young
deep love person hide the heart does not hang mouth
no matter what happens i am here for you
i know the people i really care about a few
if i am the girl in your dreams
live every day as the last day of life
unfortunately the sum of the young tied to a piece of
softhearted is sick but you are life
everything is going on
you will have it if it belongs to you whereas you do not kveth for it if it does not appear in your life
when you have no one to love you love yourself on your
when the mood is fallen only thought is to abandon all
i pretend i do not care you but still i feel the pain
not pretend to be silent but have no strength to complain
there will always be one day you will let go of today is persistence and disappointment with a little regret to start a new life without that person
our story begins with strangers and ends with strangers
fall in love with a wrong person there is no right person
i am good at acting especially pretending to be happy
some memories are doomed to be unable to cancel is just like some people is doomed to be unable to substitute is the
it sucks when you know that you need to let go but you can not because you are still waiting for the impossible to happen
every heartless person there is a period for someone heart out of the lung once
back to the origin from now on my new life
if we can only encounter each other rather than stay with each other then i wish we had never encountered
you are the wall that i have run into the joy of a fool is dream
i do not know what is missing but i am not as happy as i used to be
the nine thing most afraid of life deceit hypocrisy excuse lost parting expose perfunctory betrayal lie
all that you have lost can be won back bit by as long as you wish for it
you say i have changed i admit it
i am just noe sticking to you like i did before
it is only because i can not waste my love on the one who has never loved me
the worst part of life is waiting the best part of life is having someone worth waiting for
having real happiniess is to live the way you want rather than that of others
time can heal a broken heart but time can also break a waiting heart
the ones who love me will never leave me
even if there are a hundred reasons to give up they will find one reason to hold on
someday you will find the one who will watch every sunrise with you until the sunset of your life
do not aim for success if you want it
just do what you love and believe in and it will come naturally
spread besuty and happiness wher ever you stay
irrespective of your surroundings
without ideal there is no secure direction
without direction there is no life
when someone else is happiness is your happiness that is love
do not mind what others said how to evaluate you
you are you only you you unique irreplaceable
i do not cry do not represent my heart has no tears
i am strong dose not mean that no matter what happened
i heard that it is very easy to be happy as could be diluted with time going on
we would fade into someone at least one time in life not for any result company ownership even love just for meeting you in my most beautiful days
take out your complaints in the sun every day the mood will not lack calcium
as long as your heart is sunny life is not a rainy day
it does not matter how often we see each other what matters most is how much we think about each other
it is not easy to grow up some people will never grow up some refuse to do and some pretend not to do
you are the one in particular i care i treasure
sometimes the question are complicated and the answers are simple
a man is life will meet many people who love him it might be mistake for liking
in fact it is onle a moment of good feeling
after all heart is not the answer
everything happens for a reason
before finding the right people the only need to do is to make yourself good enough
is a good habit to give up a kind of wisdom laughed off the language is kind of open-minded pain without words is a kind of self-cultivation
memory is a wonderful thing if you do not have to deal with the past
love is like the wind i can not see it but i can feel it
you never know how to sneer at a person who is silly to you is how much you love you
those who love you will not hurt you and those who hurt you do not deserve you
stranger think i was quite my friends think i am very cheerful my best friend know that i is a lunatic
to love someone is very simple actually
although he makes you cry and disappoints you you will still can not help holding his hand wherever he is
i believe good things happen every day
be what you want to be not what others want to see
i wish to be generous for the rest of my life
you can not make right decisions all the time but you can learn from wrong ones everytime
you do not miss the past
do not dwell in the past do not dream of the future concentrate your mind on the present moment
people are always hungry for nothing
and get rid of what you have
everything is going on but do not give up trying
from what i can see in your eyes i know you are my mr
if it is important to you you will find a way
if not you will find an excuse
happiness is good health and a bad memory
sometimes parting is for meeting it is like the end is for the beginning
after doing my best i chose to follow the lead
no one can change another
but one can be the reason for another to change
the best feeling in the world is knowing someone is missing you
do not let your heart is tired should learn the sake of open bearish learn to not force learn to deep
all that you have lost can be won back bit by bit as long as you wish for it
life has progress and retreat lose nothing can not lose the mood
i hope i can take every step back
it is going to make us a little bit closer to each other
i am looking forward to our future life
life would be so much easier if we only fell in love with people that would love us back
everyone has their sadness what they want to hide but try to cover up
he unhappiest people in this world are those who care the most about what other people think
you only see what i choose to show you
maybe the fault does not lie in the way but in the choice and there is nothing wrong in lovebut in destiny
if you want a happy life tie it to a goal not to people or things
life may always have regret but the future is still good
it does not matter how often we see each other what matters most is how much we think about each other
the first step of strong is to end melodramatic
the supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved
relationships or friendships are worth fighting for but not if you are the only one fighting
do not put too many people into your life
after all too much enthusiasm is never appreciated
love is like hoping for rainbows though a storm i am going through
the best way to make someone strong is to have someone who needs protection
for those things i don“t talk about it does not mean i do not know
some decisions we only need one minute but but will use all my life to regret that one minute
time such as water always silent
if you are well it is sunny
love reckons hours for months and days for years
and every little absence is an age
thinking too much of others makes you nothing in their eyes
the fact is that the world is out of everyone is expectation
but some learn to forget but others insist
a wise departure is better than a messy one
the most eternal happiness is the ordinary the longest possession is cherished
sometimes you have to show your bad side so that you can sort out who can accept you at your worst
a joke that pokes into the pain is never a joke
even if life sucks if you look at it from different point of views it will still be beautiful
even the most boring times in life are limited
love is not finding someone to live with
it is finding someone you can not live without
it is not hard to give up but it must be cool
the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let it come in
you said i would meet someone better than you
but you want someone better than me
i am not in love with him i am in love with ghosts
never do something permanently stupid just because you are temporarily upset
how long will i love you as long as stars are above you
always remember that no matter how useless you feel you are someone is reason to smile
everything is a choice
it is important to stay positive because beauty comes from the inside out
enjoy when you can and endure when you must
a lot of entanglements can be put down in an instant
no matter how serious life gets you still gotta have that one person who you can be completely stupid with
only naive people can be soft mature people are the most ruthless
you can only live brilliantly if you know how to love yourself
many things in life are like wisdom teeth
the best solution is to pull it out
the best is always last
i will leave the best for you
what is sought is often not found
all things come and go and all things have his time
see you like the wind
i am a camel that can not cross the desert
some people can not be lovers but they also can not be getted by others
the thorough revenge is to forgive and forget
we always say the years are the same
but we do not know whether it is as early as possible
all the beauty that can not go back is the best time in the world
it is great to have you in the world and i only wish that the time would be peaceful in our rest of lives
i really want to give it to you never ask if you want it
you never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have
if you continuously compete with others you become bitter
if you continuously compete with yourself you become better
never say you are not good enough if that person can not see you for who you are they are the ones who are not good enough
life is better when you spend it with people who make you happy not people who you have to always impress
you can not have a relationship without any fights but you can make your relationship worth the fight
you can not wake a person who is pretending to be asleep
do not ask why people keep hurting you
ask yourself why are you allowing it to happen
i desire to grow old with you without paying
you need to find somebody that likes you the way you are
billions of stars are not as big as you
all my future stories are about you
smile can give anyone but your heart give me a person 
it is love at first sight or at first sight
i want to be your night and i want to be your morning
there are no stars in my eyes no sea only you
what i want in life love and freedom you and gentleness
have your day is called the future do not have your day only
you are my blatant favorite known love
thanks to the time does not abandon you have been in love i have been 
a lot of things to see for a long time will be tired of but you see the more joy
love is too deep time will always keep the best for you at the end
a lot of love i know you have always been my heart is most deadly lover
the persistence of love is that i should not put my dependence on the future that i can not touch
the relief of love i can not laugh without scruple you should understand the injured person can not be able to remember
love love until the tears did not fall eyes blurred like the winddunk as pain memories away but love is in imperceptibly in the cold
i love you is i too frivolous duplicity of pain real people a little numb
keep your face always toward the sunshineand shadows will fall behind you
the world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper
and in the end it is not the years in your life that count
it is the life in your years
the world in your eyes is beautiful when you have something beautiful in your heart
i am going to give this day my very best so that i may rest my head with deep satisfaction tonight
accept what was and what is and you will have more positive energy to pursue what will be
if you can do what you do best and be happy you are furtheralong in life than most people
pains make you stronger tears make you braver andheartbreaks make you wiser
so thank the past for a better future
if you just set out to be liked you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time and you would achieve nothing
standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous
you get knocked down by the traffic from both sides
i am extraordinarily patient provided i get my own way in the end
watch your thoughts for they become words
watch your words for they become actions
watch your actions for they become habits
watch your habits for they become your character
and watch your character for it becomes your destiny
what we think we become
where there is discord may we bring harmony
where there is error may we bring truth
where there is doubt may we bring faith
where there is despair may we bring hope
there is something inside that are made out of stonethat they can not get to that they can not touch that is yours that is hope
if your starting point is to please people you have to be ready at any time in any matter compromise and you will accomplish nothing
a silent tongue and true heart are the most admirable things on earth
nobody can go back and start a new beginning but anyone can start today and make a new ending
do not part with your illusions
when they are gone you may still exist
but you have ceased to live
no man or woman is worth your tears and the one who is will not make you cry
there is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man
true nobility is being superior to your former self
one sees clearly only with the heart
anything essential is invisible to the eye
on simple happiness a worldly will grow old
keep a young heart do a simple people enjoy sunshine and warmth
life does not just happen to you
you receive everything in your life based on what you have given
at twenty years of age the will reigns
and at forty the judgment
not easily cut open to others because others are hilarious and the pain is yourself
love as drinking if it light will be tasteless but liquor burning throat
obviously the rise is oxygen but would rather lonely to suffocation
sometimes it is not the person you miss but the time the memory you stay with him
just keep your mind open and suck in the experience and if it hurts it is probably worth it
i know someone in the world is waiting for me although i have no idea of who he is
but i feel happy every day for this
happiness is not about being immortal nor having food or rights in one is hand
it is about having each tiny wish come true or having something to eat when you are hungry or having someone is love when you need love
among those people that appear in our life some are to teach us some to comfortus some to share and some to love
we all live in the past
we take a minute to know someone one hour to like someone and one day to love someone but the whole life to forget someone
someone makes me comfortable so i want to rely on him
while another one makes me feel lonely so i want to embrace him
