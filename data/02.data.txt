on simple happiness a worldly will grow old
keep a young heart do a simple people enjoy sunshine and warmth
life does not just happen to you
you receive everything in your life based on what you have given
at twenty years of age the will reigns
and at forty the judgment
not easily cut open to others because others are hilarious and the pain is yourself
love as drinking if it light will be tasteless but liquor burning throat
obviously the rise is oxygen but would rather lonely to suffocation
sometimes it is not the person you miss but the time the memory you stay with him
just keep your mind open and suck in the experience and if it hurts it is probably worth it
i know someone in the world is waiting for me although i have no idea of who he is
but i feel happy every day for this
happiness is not about being immortal nor having food or rights in one is hand
it is about having each tiny wish come true or having something to eat when you are hungry or having someone is love when you need love
among those people that appear in our life some are to teach us some to comfortus some to share and some to love
we all live in the past
we take a minute to know someone one hour to like someone and one day to love someone but the whole life to forget someone
someone makes me comfortable so i want to rely on him
while another one makes me feel lonely so i want to embrace him
